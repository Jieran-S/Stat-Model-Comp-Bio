## Question 12

### (1)
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  P(t + dt) = P(dt)P(t) = (I + Rdt)P(t)
\end{align}
```
Therefore we can show that 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = RP(t)
\end{align}
```
## Question 13

### (1) The joint probability of the tree is 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  P(X,Z|T) = P(Z_4) * P(X_5|Z_4) * P(Z_3|Z_4) * P(Z_2|Z_3) * P(Z_1|Z_3) \\
  * P(X_4|Z_2) * P(X_3|Z_2) * P(X_2|Z_1) * P(X_1|Z_1)
\end{align}
```

### (2) To do the naive calculation of P(X|T) via brute-force marginalization over the hidden nodes Z, 
for each node X, we have to marginalize out all the internal nodes Z that it is dependent on. 
Here is an example with X4. 
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  P(X_4|T) = \sum_Z P(X_4, Z|T) = \sum_Z P(X_4|Z_2)P(Z_2|Z_3)P(Z_3|Z_4)P(Z_4)\\
  = \sum_Z P(X_4, Z_2, Z_3, Z_4)
\end{align}
```
Thus for X4, we would have to sum over 3 times. For X1, X2, X3, and X4 they all depend on 3 Zs so they also have to sum 3 times. 
X5 only depends on Z4, therefore only has to sum once. In total the brute force method would require 13 summations.  

### (3)
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  P(X,Z|T) = P(Z_4) * P(X_5|Z_4) * P(Z_3|Z_4) * P(Z_2|Z_3) * P(Z_1|Z_3) \\
  * P(X_4|Z_2) * P(X_3|Z_2) * P(X_2|Z_1) * P(X_1|Z_1)
\end{align}
```
By rearranging the expression in such way we only need to do 4 summations.
